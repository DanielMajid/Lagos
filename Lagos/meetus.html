    <section class="content-section container">The Olateju sisters grew up in the strong West-African community of the Twin Cities Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota. Born to Nigerian immigrants, their attachment to the culture and style of Nigeria has never been far from their mind. After countless family events having done the exhaustive work of coordinating the shipment of quality clothes from the market, to the taior and then then to their home in the US, the three sisters put their heads together looking for a way to bring simplicity and predictability to the whole process</p>
    <p>"We are ready to do the hard work so that you can look and feel your best. We work with trusted artesains to source these one-of-a-kind fabrics."</p>
