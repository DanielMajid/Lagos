    <div class="subhead">WOL is a collective of sisters who facilitate the import of fine textiles from West African producers for the use in traditional tailoring.</div> We work exclusively with small operations led and operated by women. Each fold of cloth was hand sewn and indentified in-person for quality before making its way West.</p>
